# The syntax is "key = value". The whitespace around the equals doesn't matter.
# Comments start with `#` and are only valid on their own line.
# Blank lines are ignored.

# When you specify ANY keybind line, all default keybindings are cleared
# and only your specified bindings will be active. This gives you full
# control over every keybinding.
