# The syntax is "key = value". The whitespace around the equals doesn't matter.
# Comments start with `#` and are only valid on their own line.
# Blank lines are ignored.
#
# Keybindings are additive — your bindings are merged with the defaults.
# Use "unbind" to remove a default binding you don't want.

# --- General settings ---

# Show hidden files (dotfiles) by default.

# Theme to use. When set, overrides terminal colors with a Ghostty-compatible
# theme. Themes are searched in:

#   2. /Applications/Ghostty.app/Contents/Resources/ghostty/themes/<name> (macOS)
#   3. ~/.config/ghostty/themes/<name>
#
# Leave unset or empty to inherit colors from your terminal.
# theme = TokyoNight
# theme = Catppuccin Mocha
# theme = Dracula
